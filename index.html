  <h1>My Basketball Journey</h1>
  <p> My name is Julian Hernandez and basically my Basketball journey started 9 years ago. Nine years ago i was only 5 and what inspired me to play basketball is watching my dads old basketball highlights and one day when my dad got out of jail he went to my house and decided to take me to the park. When we got to the park i thought he was taking so i can go play on the slides and the swings but i was wrong he took me and told me he was going to start teaching me how to play basketball. When i got Home i started telling my mom how i wanted to start playing for a team and one day when i was in school they gave me a paper to like tryout for the USA youth sports and i joined and ever since then i started getting better and better. I won like 4 trophies with The Youth sports team and the coaches that i had were awesome they taught me so much and as i got older i started getting better until one day i went to tryouts for middle school and made it and starting practing even more.
